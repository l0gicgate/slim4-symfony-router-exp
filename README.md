# Slim 4 - Symfony Routing Experiment

## Motivation
This experiment was motivated by one of the original features that I developed for Slim 4. I wanted to make routing modular so you weren't bound to [FastRoute](https://github.com/nikic/FastRoute). While it is an exceptional router, Symfony came out with a [faster router](https://symfony.com/doc/current/routing.html) in February 2018

## Benchmarks
I don't have benchmarks at the moment, but it'd be great if someone competent was able to use this proof of concept code to run some!

## The question
Should we make this a library?
